Simply Spring-JPA application that can connect to the database.

Inside application 3 types of datasource are configured and each one is connected to a specific profile:
- mysql datasource
- h2 on localhost datasource
For this we need to start H2 database before. To do it we can use H2 server that will be in maven dependencies:
cd ~/.m2/repository/com/h2database/h2/1.4.190
java -cp h2-1.4.190.jar org.h2.tools.Server
After that web console will be opened and we can start the database. We need to start Generic H2 (Server).
- in memory H2 datasource - db will be automatically started
